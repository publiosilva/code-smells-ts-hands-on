# Long Method

## Description
A Long Method is a method that contains too many lines of code or has too many responsibilities. These methods are difficult to understand, maintain, and test. They often violate the Single Responsibility Principle and make the code harder to read and modify.

## Common Symptoms
- Method is longer than 20-30 lines of code
- Method has multiple levels of nesting
- Method contains multiple responsibilities
- Method has many parameters
- Method is difficult to understand at a glance
- Method has many local variables

## Refactoring Methods
1. **Extract Method**: Break down the long method into smaller, more focused methods
2. **Replace Temp with Query**: Replace temporary variables with method calls
3. **Introduce Parameter Object**: Group related parameters into a single object
4. **Replace Method with Method Object**: Convert the method into a class
5. **Decompose Conditional**: Break down complex conditional statements
6. **Extract Class**: Move the method to a new class if it belongs there
7. **Split Temporary Variable**: Break down complex temporary variables

## Benefits of Refactoring
- Improved code readability
- Better maintainability
- Easier testing
- Reduced complexity
- Better code organization
- More reusable code
- Easier to understand the method's purpose
