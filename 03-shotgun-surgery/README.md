# Shotgun Surgery

## Description
Shotgun Surgery occurs when a single change requires modifications to multiple classes or methods. This indicates that the code is not well-organized and that related functionality is scattered across different parts of the codebase. It's the opposite of the God Class problem, where functionality is too spread out rather than too concentrated.

## Common Symptoms
- Making a single change requires modifying multiple classes
- Related functionality is scattered across different classes
- Changes in one place require changes in many other places
- High coupling between classes
- Difficult to maintain and modify the code
- Changes are risky because they affect many parts of the system

## Refactoring Methods
1. **Move Method**: Move related methods to the same class
2. **Move Field**: Move related fields to the same class
3. **Inline Class**: Merge classes that are tightly coupled
4. **Extract Class**: Create a new class to hold related functionality
5. **Introduce Parameter Object**: Group related parameters into a single object
6. **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: Use polymorphism to handle different cases
7. **Form Template Method**: Extract common behavior into a template method

## Benefits of Refactoring
- Reduced coupling between classes
- Easier maintenance
- More localized changes
- Better code organization
- Improved code reusability
- Reduced risk when making changes
- Better adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle
