# Divergent Change

## Description
Divergent Change occurs when a class is frequently modified for different reasons. This indicates that the class has multiple responsibilities and violates the Single Responsibility Principle. The class is changed in different ways for different reasons, making it difficult to maintain and understand.

## Common Symptoms
- Class is modified for different reasons
- Class has multiple responsibilities
- Changes to one feature affect other features
- Class is modified in different ways
- Class has low cohesion
- Class is difficult to test
- Class has many dependencies

## Refactoring Methods
1. **Extract Class**: Split the class into multiple classes based on responsibilities
2. **Move Method**: Move methods to more appropriate classes
3. **Move Field**: Move fields to more appropriate classes
4. **Extract Interface**: Create interfaces to define clear boundaries
5. **Replace Inheritance with Delegation**: Use composition instead of inheritance
6. **Split Class**: Divide the class into multiple classes based on responsibilities
7. **Introduce Facade**: Create a facade to simplify the interface

## Benefits of Refactoring
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier maintenance
- More focused classes
- Better code organization
- Reduced coupling
- Easier testing
- More maintainable code
- Better adherence to Single Responsibility Principle
