# Switch Statements

## Description
Switch Statements (or large if-else chains) become a code smell when they are used to make decisions based on object types or when they are repeated across the codebase. They often violate the Open/Closed Principle and make the code harder to maintain and extend.

## Common Symptoms
- Large switch statements or if-else chains
- Switch statements repeated in multiple places
- Switch statements that check object types
- Switch statements that violate the Single Responsibility Principle
- Switch statements that make it difficult to add new cases
- Switch statements that contain business logic

## Refactoring Methods
1. **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: Use inheritance and polymorphism instead of switch statements
2. **Extract Method**: Move the switch logic into a separate method
3. **Move Method**: Move the switch to the class that should handle the decision
4. **Replace Type Code with State/Strategy**: Use the State or Strategy pattern
5. **Introduce Null Object**: Replace null checks with a Null Object pattern
6. **Replace Parameter with Explicit Methods**: Create specific methods for each case
7. **Form Template Method**: Extract common behavior into a template method

## Benefits of Refactoring
- Better adherence to Open/Closed Principle
- Easier to add new cases
- More maintainable code
- Better code organization
- Reduced duplication
- More flexible design
- Easier to test
- Better separation of concerns
