# God Class

## Description
A God Class is a class that knows too much or does too much. It violates the Single Responsibility Principle by having too many responsibilities and dependencies. These classes tend to grow over time as more functionality is added, making them difficult to maintain and understand.

## Common Symptoms
- The class has too many methods and properties
- The class has many dependencies on other classes
- The class name is too generic (e.g., "Manager", "Helper", "Utils")
- The class is frequently modified for different reasons
- The class has low cohesion between its methods

## Refactoring Methods
1. **Extract Class**: Split the God Class into smaller, more focused classes
2. **Move Method**: Move methods to more appropriate classes
3. **Move Field**: Move fields to more appropriate classes
4. **Extract Interface**: Create interfaces to define clear boundaries
5. **Replace Inheritance with Delegation**: If the class is using inheritance, consider using composition instead
6. **Split Class**: Divide the class into multiple classes based on responsibilities
7. **Introduce Facade**: Create a facade to simplify the interface of a complex subsystem

## Benefits of Refactoring
- Improved code maintainability
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier testing
- Reduced complexity
- Better code organization
- More reusable components
