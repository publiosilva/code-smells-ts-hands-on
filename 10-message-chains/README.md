# Message Chains

## Description
Message Chains occur when a client requests a service from an object, which in turn requests a service from another object, and so on. This creates tight coupling between the classes in the chain and violates the Law of Demeter. The code becomes fragile as changes in any part of the chain can affect the entire chain.

## Common Symptoms
- Long chains of method calls (e.g., `a.getB().getC().getD()`)
- Client code depends on the structure of the chain
- Changes in the chain affect multiple places
- High coupling between classes
- Violation of the Law of Demeter
- Difficult to maintain and modify
- Brittle code that breaks easily

## Refactoring Methods
1. **Hide Delegate**: Create a method in the first object that handles the chain
2. **Extract Method**: Move the chain into a separate method
3. **Move Method**: Move the method to a more appropriate class
4. **Inline Class**: Merge classes in the chain if they're too tightly coupled
5. **Introduce Local Extension**: Create an extension class to handle the chain
6. **Replace Delegation with Inheritance**: If appropriate, use inheritance instead
7. **Introduce Parameter Object**: Group related parameters into a single object

## Benefits of Refactoring
- Reduced coupling between classes
- Better encapsulation
- More maintainable code
- Easier to modify
- Better adherence to Law of Demeter
- More flexible design
- Easier to test
- Better code organization
